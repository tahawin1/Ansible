![Project.drawio.png](project.drawio.png)




## Description
This project utilizes Ansible for advanced Linux/Unix administration tasks, focusing on automation and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It includes playbooks for web server configuration, security, RBAC, and load balancing using Nginx.

## File Structure
- *files:* Directory containing configuration files.
- *hosts:* Inventory file listing target hosts.
- *nginx_lb_playbook.yml:* Ansible playbook for configuring Nginx as a load balancer.
- *rbac_configuration.yml:* Ansible playbook for RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) configuration.
- *README.md:* This file - your guide to the project.
- *security_conf_playbook.yml:* Ansible playbook for comprehensive security configuration.
- *update_playbook.yml:* Ansible playbook for scheduled system updates.
- *web_server_playbook.yml:* Ansible playbook for setting up and configuring web servers.

## Instructions
1. Ensure Ansible is installed on your machine.
2. Modify the 'hosts' inventory file to include your target servers.
3. Run individual playbooks using the following commands:

   - *Web Servers Playbook:*
     bash
     ansible-playbook -i hosts web_server_playbook.yml --ask-become-pass
     

   - *Load Balancer Playbook:*
     bash
     ansible-playbook -i hosts nginx_lb_playbook.yml
     

   - *RBAC Configuration Playbook:*
     bash
     ansible-playbook -i hosts rbac_configuration.yml --ask-become-pass
     

   - *Security Configuration Playbook:*
     bash
     ansible-playbook -i hosts security_conf_playbook.yml --ask-become-pass
     

   - *Scheduled Updates Playbook:*
     bash
     ansible-playbook -i hosts update_playbook.yml --ask-become-pass
     

## Suggestions for Improvement
1. Consider using Vagrant for virtualization.
2. Create a master playbook to execute all playbooks in a specific order.
3. Utilize Ansible Vault to secure sensitive information such as SSH keys.

For more details and customization, refer to the specific playbook files and configurations in the project.
